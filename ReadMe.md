# News App

News App is a multi-page react native app that communicate with an open source NEWS API (https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve news updates from.

This app uses react-native, expo-cli and typescript.

## TypeScript:

TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

## Expo:

Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools.

## Installation

Use the package manager YARN or NPM to install dependencies.

```cmd
yarn install or npm install
```

## Usage

Using expo cli start your applciation using:

```cmd
yarn start or npm start or expo start
```
